                <p> Personal Website </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Created a personal website using NodeJS, HTML, CSS and AWS. This current website is the one I am speaking of. <br>
                All the server code is in NodeJS, and can be found in github. The responses from the website are basic, it is a static website.
                I am using this project as a stepping stone in developing a dynamic web application for end-to-end encrypted communications. <br>
                All HTML and CSS were written by me.

                I have an interest with computer security, as well as privacy. So, I decided to create this encrypted chat service to reflect on that
                , as well as gain experience in cryptography, web development, and web security. <br>

                    The Threat Model
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Server can not be trusted. </li>
                    <li> Nation state actors sniffing network. </li>
                    <li> DDOS attacks. </li>
                    <li> DNS spoofing. </li>
                    <li> Nation states actively blocking access. </li>
                    <li> Phishing/XSS attacks/CSRF attacks.</li>
                    <li> Client themselves are vunerable. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                The design of the system was made with this threat model in mind. <br>
                Servers are always being exploited into, therefore, we must assume that the server is compromised at all times to ensure that users are kept safe.
                One of the most basic things that the server must do, is to keep all data encrypted on the server, with the users only having the ability to
            </p>

            <p>
                Server cannot be trusted <br>
                In the event that the server is compromised, we want users to still be able to send and recieve messages while still having their identity anon.
                Additionally, messages sent should be confidential, and need to preserve intergity. </br>
                Therefore, encryption happens on the user's end. The client only ever sends encypted data to the server, on top of TLS. All data is then
                recieved by the end user, who verifies and decrypts the data. <br>

                Privilege Seperation<br>
                Services should be serperated based on the idea of least privilege. <br>
                If one service is exposed, others are not. <br>
                All services should talk via TLS. Example NSA Snowden leaks. <br>

                What about server sending things out of order? Prevent messages being sent <br>

                Idea: Order the messages, computationally impossible to try to reodrder messages. <br>
                Idea 2: Give clients/users a time stamp like TLS certificates. Where messages can time out. <br>
                Idea 3: Check for duplicates. <br>


                Ultimately, the server can deny service. Example: China and telegram<br>
                Can we do something about that? What about creating a peer to peer network? Use optional peer to peer?
